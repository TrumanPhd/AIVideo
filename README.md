# üé¨ AI Video Production & Automated Publishing Framework

This repository contains a set of scripts for fully automating the AI video production process, from generating video prompts and the videos themselves, to adding background music and automatically publishing them on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, etc.

This project aims to explore and implement a complete pipeline for scalable AI-driven content creation.

## üöÄ Project Goals

*   Automate the entire video production workflow using AI models.
*   Generate creative and imaginative video content based on text prompts.
*   Automatically select and add suitable background music.
*   Streamline the publishing process to multiple short video platforms.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **LLM-based Prompt Generation:** Utilizes language models (like Zhipu GLM-4) to create diverse and engaging video prompts.
*   **AI Video Generation:** Integrates with various Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V) models (Pika, Keling, etc.).
*   **Automated Music Matching:** Matches background music from a local library based on video content or prompts.
*   **Multi-platform Publishing:** Scripts for automated uploading to platforms like YouTube and TikTok.
*   **Structured Output:** Organized video storage with clear naming conventions.

## üí° Project Ideas & Implementation Details

Here are some of the thoughts behind building this project:

**1. Overall Process**
LLM Generates Video Prompt -> Video Generation Model -> Local Background Music Matching (based on text prompt) -> Publishing
macbook -> Get TP from LLM Server -> macbook -> Send TP to T2V Model -> Download video to macbook -> Search local library for corresponding audio -> Match and synthesize corresponding video -> Local video storage & publish to multiple platforms.

**2. Registration and Deployment**
*   **Tiktok / Douyin (ByteDance ecosystem including Xigua Video)** Requires administrator approval.
*   **Bilibili** Requires verification.
*   **Youtube** Already working.
*   **Kuaishou**
*   Video titles for Chinese platforms need localization.

2.1 **text2video:** Generate imaginative scenes that don't exist in reality.
*   **Effect Validation**
    *   Call Zhipu GLM API to generate semantic prompts.
    *   Call to generate videos:
        1.  Highly imaginative videos combining popular online memes.

2.2 **image2video:**
1.  **Video Types: (Can register multiple accounts using different emails)**
    1.  Suggestive content: Large-scale real beauties, anime beauties, micro-movements - dancing. Some models may refuse to generate these.
    2.  Fighting, Kung Fu.
    3.  TP -> Diffusion model -> Video.
    4.  Historical progress type?
    5.  Highly imaginative type?
    6.  Real scenes transformed into imaginary virtual scenes.

**3. Implementation Plan**
*   **Requirements:** Write Python scripts, add Chinese comments, run in a mac environment. Automate the **entire process** from video generation to publishing. Text prompts call language model API, video generation models are cloud-based.
*   **Call Language Model to Automatically Generate text prompt:** Requires being highly creative and imaginative, with wild ideas. To be published on short video platforms, they must be able to attract subscriptions and likes. The video thumbnail on video platforms is usually the first frame of the video.
*   **Path Parameter Requirements:**
    *   Save generated videos in the `/Users/truman/AIGC/Video` folder.
    *   Naming rule: `V` + Date + Code (Example: `V20251230000001`).
*   **Automatic Video Publishing Platforms:**
    *   Youtube `@VideoAIGC` account.
    *   Tiktok `@videoaigc` account.
*   **Model Call:** Pika series models.
*   **Video Content Prompt Generation:** Generated via Zhipu GLM-4.
*   **Background Music:** Automatically add background music after downloading the generated video.

**4. Build Background Music Library**
*   **5-second Background Music Library:** Categorized by emotion.
*   **10-second Library:** To be done later.

**5. Video Generation Models**
*   Most can directly do T2V. Some allow adding Image prompts to improve effects.
*   **Main:**
    *   **Pika Series:** 0.5 seconds. Recommended. I2V, T2V, I+T2V. Second cheapest recommended, easy to deploy.
    *   **Keling:** 1.6. Recommended. Provides T2V, T+(1-4)I2V multiple interfaces. Only use 5 seconds. Cheapest. Requires domestic mobile phone login. API access is expensive.
*   **Backup:**
    *   **Runway Gen-3:** Highest quality (Gen-2 has Western bias due to training data). 5 RMB per video is too expensive, not recommended.
    *   **T2V: Tencent Hunyuan:** https://aivideo.hunyuan.tencent.com/. Primarily horizontal, generated vertical videos look like two horizontal ones stitched together. Picture quality needs improvement, action range needs consideration. API: https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1729. 5 seconds. No API call interface.
    *   **I2V, T2V (T2I2V): Stable Video Diffusion:** Only 4 seconds. Easily refuses to generate large-scale content, not recommended. https://www.stablevideo.com/generate.
    *   **T2V: Meta MovieGen:** Not yet publicly available, will try later.
    *   **T2V: Google Veo2:** Not yet publicly available, will try later.
    *   **T2V: Sora V2:** 20/200$, bundled with GPT, Tier 1. But not the best effect, not cost-effective. Can try.
    *   **T2V: ModelScope Text to Video:** Clarity is not good, too weak, barely usable, old free model from 23 years ago.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Notes & Considerations

1) Inconsistencies may occur in certain niche scenes.
2) **Use English for prompt words!**
3) Older models are not good at generating realistic content. Try to use Cartoon style.
4) When using image prompts, some models will refuse to generate suggestive or large-scale content.
5) When 5 seconds and 10 seconds are optional, always use 5 seconds. Current models' 10-second videos are too empty.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

*   Python environment
*   macOS operating system (scripts are currently designed for mac)
*   Access to relevant AI model APIs (e.g., Zhipu GLM, Pika API, Keling API)
*   Accounts for target publishing platforms (Youtube, TikTok) with necessary permissions.
